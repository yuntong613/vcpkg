# Manifests -- `vcpkg.json`

For many other language package managers, there exists a way of writing one's dependencies in a declarative
manifest format; we want something similar for vcpkg. What follows is the specification of that feature;
this should mean that vcpkg becomes far more user and enterprise-friendly, and is additionally an important
first step for versioning and package federation. Our primary concern, beyond implementability, is ease-of-use;
it is important that using this feature is all of:

* Easy for existing users
* Easy for new users to set up
* Easy to extend later for new features like versioning and federation
* _Declarative_, not _Imperative_.

## Reasoning

### Why JSON?

We choose JSON for five main reasons:

* Everybody knows JSON, and if one doesn't, it's really easy to learn
* Every tool supports JSON in the standard library, or in a commonly used support library
  * This means writing tooling should be trivial in any language one is comfortable with
  * Most configuration formats don't have a COBOL implementation üòâ
* Specified in an international standard
  * There is _one_ right way to parse JSON
  * There are no ambiguities of what the parse tree _should_ be
* Simple and secure
  * Unlike YAML, for example, there's no weird ACE issues
  * Easy to write a parser -- important since we can't depend on external libraries
* Schemas are almost a necessity

Some have suggested allowing comments or commas in our parser; we chose to use JSON proper
rather than JSON5 or JSON with comments because JSON is the everywhere-supported international
standard. That is not necessarily true of JSON with comments. Additionally, if one needs
to write a comment, they can do so via `"$reason"` or `"$comment"` fields.

### Why are `<platform-specification>`s so verbose?

In the initial implementation, we didn't want to do more parsing than is strictly necessary,
especially parsing languages which aren't defined anywhere. We may add a shorter way of
defining platform specifications in the future (more similar to those in control files).

## Specification

A manifest file shall have the name `vcpkg.json`, and shall be in the root directory of a package.
It also replaces CONTROL files, though existing CONTROL files will still be
supported; there will be no difference between ports and packages, except
that packages do not need to supply portfile.cmake (eventually we would like
to remove the requirement of portfile.cmake for ports that already use
CMake).

The specification uses definitions from the [Definitions](#definitions) section in order
to specify the shape of a value. Note that any object may contain any directives, written as
a field key that starts with a `$`; these directive shall be ignored by `vcpkg`. Common
directives may include `"$schema"`, `"$comment"`, `"$reason"`.

A manifest must be a top-level object, and must have at least the following properties:

* `"name"`: a `<package-name>`
* `"version"`: A `string`. This will be defined further later.
  * [Semver](https://semver.org) is recommended but not required.

The simplest vcpkg.json looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "mypackage",
  "version": "0.1.0-dev"
}
```

Additionally, it may contain the following properties:
* `"port-version"`: A non-negative integer. If this field doesn't exist, it's assumed to be `0`.
  * Note that this is a change from existing CONTROL files, where versions were a part of the version string
* `"authors"`: An array of `string`s which contain the authors of a package
  * `"authors": [ "Nicole Mazzuca <nicole@example.com>", "◊©◊ú◊ï◊ù ◊¢◊ú◊ô◊õ◊ù <shalom@example.com>" ]`
* `"description"`: A string or array of strings containing the description of a package
  * `"description": "mypackage is a package of mine"`
* `"homepage"`: A url which points to the homepage of a package
  * `"homepage": "https://github.com/strega-nil/mypackage"`
* `"documentation"`: A url which points to the documentation of a package
  * `"documentation": "https://readthedocs.io/strega-nil/mypackage"`
* `"license"`: A `<license-string>`
  * `"license": "MIT"`
* `"dependencies"`: An array of `<dependency>`s
* `"dev-dependencies"`: An array of `<dependency>`s which are required only for developers (testing and the like)
* `"features"`: An array of `<feature>`s that the package supports
* `"default-features"`: An array of `<identifier>`s that correspond to features, which will be used by default.
* `"supports"`: A `<platform-specification>`
  * `"supports": { "and": [ "win", { "not": "arm" } ] }`

Any properties which are not listed, and which do not start with a `$`,
will be warned against and are reserved for future use.

The following is an example of an existing port CONTROL file rewritten as a vcpkg.json file:

```
Source: pango
Version: 1.40.11-6
Homepage: https://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/pango/
Description: Text and font handling library.
Build-Depends: glib, gettext, cairo, fontconfig, freetype, harfbuzz[glib] (!(windows&static)&!osx)
```

```json
{
  "name": "pango",
  "version": "1.40.11",
  "port-version": 6,
  "homepage": "https://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/pango/",
  "description": "Text and font handling library.",
  "dependencies": [
    "glib",
    "gettext",
    "cairo",
    "fontconfig",
    "freetype",
    {
      "name": "harfbuzz",
      "features": [ "glib" ],
      "platform": {
        "and": [
          { "not": { "and": [ "windows", "static" ] } },
          { "not": "osx" }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

You may notice that the platform specification is fairly wordy. See [reasoning](#why-are-platform-specifications-so-verbose) for why.

## Behavior of the Tool

There will be two "modes" for vcpkg from this point forward: "classic", and "modern".
The former will act exactly like the existing vcpkg workflow, so as to avoid breaking
anyone. The latter will be the mode only when the user either:

* Passes `--manifest-root-dir=<directory>` (initially, `x-manifest-root-dir`)
* Runs `vcpkg` in a directory that contains a file named `vcpkg.json`, or in a
  child directory of a directory containing `vcpkg.json`.
  * For this, initially vcpkg will warn that the behavior will change in the
    future, and simply run in classic mode, unless the feature flag `manifests` is
    passed via:
    * The environment variable `VCPKG_FEATURE_FLAGS`
    * The option `--feature-flags`
      * (e.g., `--feature-flags=binarycaching,manifests`)

Additionally, we'll add the `--x-classic-mode` flag to allow someone to force classic
mode.

When in "modern" mode, the `installed` directory will be changed to
`<manifest-root>/vcpkg_installed` (name up for bikeshedding).
The following commands will change behavior:

* `vcpkg install` without any port arguments will install the dependencies listed in
  the manifest file, and will remove any dependencies
  which are no longer in the dependency tree implied by the manifest file.
* `vcpkg install` with port arguments will give an error.
* `vcpkg x-clean` will be added, and will delete your `vcpkg_installed` directory.

The following commands will not work in modern mode, at least initially:

* `vcpkg x-set-installed`: `vcpkg install` serves the same function
* `vcpkg remove`
* `vcpkg export`
* `vcpkg import`
* `vcpkg create`

We may add these features back for modern mode once we understand how best to
implement them.

### Behavior of the Toolchain

Mostly, the toolchain file stays the same; however, we shall add one public cache variable:

```cmake
VCPKG_MANIFEST_ROOT:PATH=<path to the directory containing the vcpkg.json file>
```

and one function:

```cmake
vcpkg_acquire_dependencies(
  [TRIPLET <triplet>]
  [MANIFEST <path to manifest>]
  [INSTALL_DIRECTORY <install directory>])
```

which installs the dependencies required by the manifest file.

The default for `TRIPLET` is `VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET`
(which is the default triplet for the configured system).
For example, on x64 Windows, it defaults to `x64-windows`.

The default for `INSTALL_DIRECTORY` is `${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/vcpkg_installed`.

Additionally, in the course of implementation, we would like to
look at adding the following function, but may not be able to:

It is almost certain that one should guard any use of this function
by `if(EXISTS CACHE{VCPKG_MANIFEST_FILE})`.

### Example - CMake Integration

An example of using the new vcpkg manifests feature for a new
project follows:

The filesystem structure should look something like:

```
example/
  src/
    main.cxx
  CMakeLists.txt
  vcpkg.json
```

Then, `main.cxx` might look like:

```cpp
#include <fmt/format.h>

int main() {
  fmt::print("Hello, {}!", "world");
}
```

Therefore, in `vcpkg.json`, we'll need to depend on `fmt`:

```json
{
  "name": "example",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "dependencies": [
    "fmt"
  ]
}
```

Then, let's write our `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)

project(example CXX)

if(EXISTS CACHE{VCPKG_MANIFEST_FILE})
  vcpkg_acquire_dependencies()
endif()


add_executable(example src/main.cxx)

find_package(fmt REQUIRED)

target_link_libraries(example
  PRIVATE
    fmt::fmt)
```

And finally, to configure and build:

```sh
$ cd example
$ cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$VCPKG_ROOT/scripts/buildsystem/vcpkg.cmake
... configuring and installing...
$ cmake --build build
```

and we're done! `fmt` will get installed into
`example/build/vcpkg_installed`, and we can run our executable with:

```sh
$ build/example
Hello, world!
```

## Definitions

  * Is entirely ASCII
  * Contains only lowercase alphabetic characters, digits, and hyphen-minus
  * Does not have multiple consecutive hyphens
  * Does not begin nor end with a hyphen
  * Is not a Windows filesystem reserved name
